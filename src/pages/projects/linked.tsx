        Linked is a word puzzle game where you link five words by their first
        and last letters. It can be played either on the website or the Android
        app. The game was released in June 2024, with the website built in
        Next.js and the app in React Native.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        Building the app was the first time I used React Native. I tried to make
        a unique puzzle that felt like it could be included with the other New
        York Times word games. Before Linked's release, I changed the game's
        core mechanics many times to make sure it was generally easy to
        understand, fun, original, and balanced.
