        Welcome, you're already here. JakeO.dev is my personal/portfolio website
        where you can find all of my projects, posts, and profiles.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        I used Google Sites to build the first version of this website in
        September 2020, switched to HTML/CSS/JavaScript in May 2021, then
        started using Tailwind CSS in September 2022, and I most recently
        rewrote everything with Next.js in January 2024. During that time, the
        design was always changing, but I always tried to keep the core of the
        website consistent.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        This website first lived on the domain Jorch.xyz in September 2020, but
        I eventually switched it to JakeO.dev in December 2022.

        The bunny you see in the header is just the Android rabbit emoji without
        any of its features. When I first added it to the website, it was just
        the emoji. Sometime in 2021, I colored it light blue, and later just
        kept the silhouette with a light-blue gradient.

        <a href="https://lexend.com" target="_blank" className="link">
          Lexend Deca
        </a>{" "}
        is the font I use the most throughout this website and my other
        projects. I started using it because it isn't very widely used, and
        according to its designers, it improves reading speed and accuracy. I
        also created a font based on my own handwriting, which I use instead of
        Lexend wherever my name is.
