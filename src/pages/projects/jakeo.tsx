        JakeO.dev is my main website which showcases all of my various websites,
        apps, social media profiles, and blog posts.

        I used Google Sites to build the first version of this website in
        September 2020, but eventually switched to HTML/CSS/JavaScript in May
        2021 where I continued to improve the design add my new projects. I
        pushed new design changes to the website every few months, only landing
        on the current design in October 2023. I started using Tailwind CSS in
        September 2022, and then rewrote everything with Next.js in January
        2024.

        I first bought the domain Jorch.xyz in September 2020, but I switched to
        the current domain, JakeO.dev, in December 2022.

      <p className="text">
        I started using the Android bunny emoji as my "logo" since the first
        version on Google Sites. At first, it was just the emoji, but sometime
        in 2021 I colored it light-blue. I later removed all the bunny's
        features and just kept the silhouette with a light-blue gradient.

        is the font I use the most throughout this website and my other
        projects. I started using it because it isn't very widely used, and
        according to its designers, it improves reading speed and accuracy. I've
        also created a font based on my own handwriting which I use for this
        website's header title.
