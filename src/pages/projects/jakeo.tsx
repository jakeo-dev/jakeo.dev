        Welcome, you're already here. JakeO.dev is my personal/portfolio website
        where you can find all of my projects, posts, and profiles.

      <p className="text">
        I used Google Sites to build the first version of this website at
        Jorch.xyz in September 2020, began actually programming by switching to
        HTML/CSS/JavaScript in May 2021, changed the domain to JakeO.dev in
        December 2022, and rewrote everything with Next.js in January 2024. This
        website has been constantly changing, but I always try to keep the core
        of it consistent.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        <a href="https://lexend.com" target="_blank" className="link">
          Lexend Deca
        </a>{" "}
        is the typeface I use the most throughout this website and my other
        projects. I started using it because, according to its designers, it
        improves reading speed and accuracy. I also created a font based on my
        own handwriting, which I occasionally use here instead of Lexend.
